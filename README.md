Overview of Project:
In this analysis I created a table that will filter through the UFO sightings data. 

Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. 
Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

Users can now shorten their results by adding specifics in the different filter boxes. This will allow users to quickly search
through the data.

Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
With adding more filter boxes, users will quickly determine if this site contains valuable information. 
The two recommendations I have are adding a resources and forum section.
The website can have a resources page to other articles of UFO sightings. 
Adding a forum section will allow users to communicate with other users and share findings.
