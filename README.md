# UFOs

### Overview of Project:
In this analysis I created a table that will filter through the UFO sightings data. 

### Results:  
Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
Users can now shorten their results by adding specifics in the different filter boxes. This will allow users to quickly search
through the data.

### Summary:
With adding more filter boxes, users will quickly determine if this site contains valuable information. 
The two recommendations I have are adding a resources and forum section.
The website can have a resources page to other articles of UFO sightings. 
Adding a forum section will allow users to communicate with other users and share findings.
